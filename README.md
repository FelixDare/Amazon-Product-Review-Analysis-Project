DSA Data Analysis
This is where I started my portfolio building while taking Data Analysis with the Incubator with this practical question as a project for the completion on the training program

## Project Topic: Amazon Product Review Analysis

### Project Overview

This data Analysis Project aims to generate insight into the product and customer review data for the purpose of guidance on how to improve product, marketing strategies by analysing the various parameters in data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Source
The primary source of Data used is Excel Data and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site.

### Tools Used

- Ms Excel for Data Cleaning [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)                                                                                                                    
     - for Data collection
     - for Data Cleaning
          - Data Manipulation
          - Data Munching
- SQL server ( For Quering and Analysis)
- Power BI (for creating a report)
  

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
- What is the average discount percentage by product category?
- How many product are listed under each category?
- What is the total number of reviews per category?
- Which products have the highest average rating?
- What is the average actual price vs discounted price by category?
- Which products have the highest number of reviews?
- How many products have a discount of 50% or More?
- What is the distribution of product rating (e.g how many product are rated 3.0, 4.0 etc)?
- What is the total potential revenue (actual price x rating count) by category?
- What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g <200, 200-500, >500)?
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
- How many products have fewer than 1000 reviews?
- Which categories have products with the highest discunts?
- Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined?
- 

  ### Data Analysis

  This is where we used some Excel functions notably pivot table to perform various analysis used during our work.

I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now to my Portfolio Building
